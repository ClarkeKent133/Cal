Several Dialog Features to add, all of which the Tracker skips them as these happen instantly and behind the scenes:

- Travel ( String ) ( Changes the prefix for the mapPlacements to add String to the front of the "0x0" so that you can travel to a completely new area seperate from teh rest and its saved. If you do travel a second time with a different String then the prefix changes to String2. Also if you Travel and already have that prefix you go back to no prefix and your previous map and previous position.

- Swap (Obj1, Obj2, Dialog) ( Swaps all instances of Obj1 with Obj2 and changes their dialog to Dialog )

 

 
 Also i want to add the ability so that in Speech Narrator and Text, you can have ${Global Variable Name} and it is replaced with its value.
